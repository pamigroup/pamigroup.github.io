desp: Hi! I’m Bo Li, a Ph.D. student at the University of Macau under the supervision of Prof. Bob Zhang, with co-supervision from Prof. Qianqian Song at the University of Florida. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology, with a focus on AI-driven virtual cells and organoids, phenotypic drug discovery, and Cell Painting. Outside the lab, you’ll often find me hiking or playing badminton and table tennis. Feel free to reach out!
